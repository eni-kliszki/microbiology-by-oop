# microbiology-by-oop

Petproject:
I made this little project to practise OOP principles in Java and UML class diagram drawing.
I like this exercisize because it is a more brain than brawn project. The description can be a little complicate because of the topic, but it has at least two valid solution. It shows you can save some time with a little a math in place of using nested loops with O(n2) time-complexity.
