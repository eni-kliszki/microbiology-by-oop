# microbiology-by-oop

Petproject:
I made this little project to practise OOP principles in Java and get better at UML class diagram drawing.
I like this excersise because it is a "more brain than brawn" project. The description can be a little complicated because of the topic, but it has at least two valid solutions. It shows you can save some time with a little math instead of using nested loops with O(n2) time-complexity.
